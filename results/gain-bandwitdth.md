# Gain and Bandwidth Results

This section summarises the key performance results obtained from HFSS
simulations of the filtering transmitarray antenna.

The analysis focuses on gain behaviour, operational bandwidth, and
out-of-band suppression.

## Operating Band
The transmitarray is designed to operate in the Ku-band, approximately
within the 11.5–12.6 GHz frequency range.

Within this band, the antenna demonstrates stable transmission and
radiation characteristics suitable for directional beamforming
applications.

## Gain Performance
Simulated results show that the transmitarray achieves a consistent
realised gain across the operating band.

Key observations:
- Gain remains relatively stable within the passband
- Minimal gain ripple is observed
- Performance degradation occurs outside the designed frequency range

These results indicate effective phase control and constructive
interference across the aperture.

## Bandwidth Characteristics
The antenna achieves an approximate **3 dB gain bandwidth of 8–9%**,
which is considered strong performance for a 1-bit transmitarray design.

The bandwidth is influenced by:
- Unit cell resonance behaviour
- Integrated filtering characteristics
- Mutual coupling between adjacent elements

## Out-of-Band Suppression
Outside the operating band, the filtering behaviour of the unit cell
provides improved suppression of unwanted frequencies.

This integrated filtering reduces reliance on external RF filters and
improves overall system efficiency.

## Summary
The gain and bandwidth results demonstrate that the proposed filtering
transmitarray antenna achieves a balanced trade-off between:
- Performance
- Structural simplicity
- Practical manufacturability

These characteristics make the design suitable for compact and efficient
wireless system implementations.
